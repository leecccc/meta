note that these are just *guidelines*, there can be times where you don't need to follow these rules, but they'll give you a better chance at getting your pull requests accepted. they ensure style consistency across all team members, in turn improving the readability of our code.
anything listed here are **not final**, and can be revised at any time.

## Indent Style

for now, try to follow the BSD KNF style of indenting (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_BSD_KNF>)
```java
while (x == y) {
    something();
    somethingelse();
}
finalthing();
```
also, please **use tabs for indenting**.
